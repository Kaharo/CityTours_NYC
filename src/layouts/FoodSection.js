            Manhattan is home to a diverse array of cuisines and dining
            experiences, from casual street food to Michelin-starred
            restaurants. Here is a list of some of the top places for food in
            Manhattan

              Despite, we do not have access to up-to-date information on
              average prices for restaurants in Manhattan, as prices can change
              over time and depend on various factors such as menu items,
              specials, taxes, and service charges. However, we can give you an
              idea of what to expect in terms of prices for different types of
              restaurants in Manhattan. It's also worth noting that prices may
              vary depending on whether you're ordering a la carte or a
              prix-fixe menu, and if you're ordering a drink or a full meal.
              Some restaurants also offer a range of prices depending on the
              time of day, such as a more affordable lunch menu or a more
              expensive dinner menu. It's always best to check the prices
              directly on the restaurant's website or by calling them directly.
